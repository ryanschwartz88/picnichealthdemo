# Fixes & Enhancements Summary - October 7, 2025

## ‚úÖ Key Improvements

### Strategy Generation Workflow (Major)
- Replaced placeholder chat UI with full form-driven experience
- Required fields: account selection, title, context
- Optional fields: focus area, reference URL, supporting document upload
- Added Supabase Storage upload endpoint (`POST /api/uploads`)
- Files stored in `strategy-files` bucket with public URL for Gumloop
- Strategies now insert with validated schema and trigger Gumloop flow
- Gumloop webhook (`POST /api/gumloop/webhook`) updates strategy status + markdown sections
- Sidebar groups strategies by account and allows quick creation of new accounts via modal

### Supabase Integration
- Introduced server-side Supabase client using service role key
- Validates account existence before creating strategy
- Stores strategy `inputs` with context/focus/URLs/file link
- Handles Gumloop errors by marking strategy status as `failed`
- Added bucket auto-creation logic for uploads endpoint

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Form now shows welcome guidance, upload instructions, validation errors
- Real-time feedback on strategy submission (loading states)
- Expandable markdown cards with source links for strategy results
- Sticky header with "New Strategy" button for quick reset
- Sidebar ‚ÄúNew Account‚Äù button opens modal form
- Accounts & strategies fetched via SWR hooks with loading states

### Documentation Updates
- `README.md` updated with new flow, environment variables, API overview
- `docs/development.md` expanded with storage setup, workflow, API testing
- `docs/api.md` documents strategy, upload, webhook endpoints
- `REDESIGN_SUMMARY.md`, `CHANGES.md` capture architecture changes

### Error Handling & Stability
- Handles anonymous auth disabled gracefully (app works without login)
- Broader datetime tolerance for Supabase timestamps
- Typed API client with endpoint definitions
- Reusable `useStableCallback` helper to avoid stale closures
- Utility helpers for grouping strategies and building inputs

|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `POST /api/strategies`      | Creates strategy request, validates input, triggers Gumloop |
| `GET /api/strategies`       | Lists strategies (optional `accountId`)                      |
| `POST /api/uploads`         | Uploads supporting document to Supabase Storage             |

## üß≠ Testing Checklist

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Create account via sidebar
3. Submit strategy form with context + optional file
